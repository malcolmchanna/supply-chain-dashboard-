# AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analysis

I conducted data analysis and designed a dashboard in Power BI.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India, operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. With plans to expand to other metro/tier 1 cities in the next two years, the company is facing issues with service delivery. Several key customers have not renewed their annual contracts due to service lapses, likely caused by delays or incomplete deliveries over a sustained period, leading to poor customer satisfaction. Management aims to address these issues before expanding and has tasked the supply chain analytics team to monitor ‘On-time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service levels daily to respond quickly to any problems.

The supply chain team will use standard metrics to measure service levels, including ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and ‘On-time in full (OTIF) %’ for customer orders against the set targets.

## Task List

Peter Pandey, a newly hired data analyst on the supply chain team, has been briefed about the task in a stakeholder business review meeting. Imagine yourself as Peter Pandey, excited to build this dashboard and perform the following tasks:

1. Create metrics according to the provided list.
2. Design a dashboard based on stakeholder requirements from the business review meeting.
3. Generate relevant insights beyond the metrics list/stakeholder meeting.

## Key Insights

- All key metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) are significantly below target.
- Orders are, on average, delayed by 0.42 days from the agreed delivery date.
- Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed Stores have the highest volume of orders and delays.
  - Are we misestimating delivery dates?
  - Are we receiving more orders than anticipated?
- Ghee, curd, and butter products are the most delayed in delivery.
- There have been no noticeable improvements in key metrics over recent months.
- There is a significant gap in IF% for most customers, possibly due to production shortfalls.
